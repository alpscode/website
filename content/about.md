### About AlpsCode

Hi there,

I originally started collecting notes about the new technologies I learned in my Dropbox folder.
When I realized that I start forgetting the ones that I do not use often, I have decided to practice with them.
So, the content of this blog is mostly about my forgotten notes being revived.
My aim is to keep every post short and concise, so that I can get what I am looking for when I need it.
Feel free to make a merge request on my [Github repository](https://github.com/alpscode/website) if you notice any errors.
