### About AlpsCode

Hi there,

Thanks for checking my website, AlpsCode!

I originally started collecting notes about the new technologies I learned in my Dropbox folder.
When I realized that I start forgetting the ones that I do not use often, I have decided to practice with them.
So, the content of this blog is mostly about my forgotten notes being revived.
My aim is to keep every post short and concise, so that I can get what I am looking for when I need it.
Feel free to make a merge request on my [Github repository](https://github.com/alpscode/website) if you notice any errors.

### Who is behind this blog?

I am Alp. I work as an Operations Research Specialist.
If you are not familiar, think of applied mathematics mixed with some software development.
I usually work on mathematical optimization, but enjoy programming as a hobby.
