### About AlpsCode

Hi there,

Thanks for checking my website, AlpsCode!

I originally started collecting notes about the new technologies I learned in my Dropbox folder.
When I realized that I start forgetting the ones that I do not use often, I have decided to practice with them.
So, the content of this blog is mostly about my forgotten notes being revived.
My aim is to keep every post short and concise, so that I can get what I am looking for when I need it.
Feel free to make a merge request on my [Github repository](https://github.com/alpscode/website) if you notice any errors.

### Who is behing this blog?

I am Alp. I work as an Operations Research Specialist.
An easy way to describe my job is simply applied math programmer.
I usually work on mathematical optimization, but enjoy programming as a hobby.
Feel free to say hi to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sertalpbilal).

### Wait a second... what do you do for a living?

My main job is to develop optimization algorithms and software.
Check my research papers on conic optimization if you are interested:

  - [Warm-start of interior point methods for second-order cone optimization via rounding over optimal Jordan frames](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2017/05/5998.html)
